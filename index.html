                  My name is Gabe Scoggin, I'm a fullstack developer specializing in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I've worked on no websites, except for this one. 
                  <br><br>
                  I grew up in the bay area, love food & wine, sports, movies and music. My wife and I live in Mountain View, which is super boring, with our 5 month old son Maverick and our dog Midnight, who are not super boring at all!
                  <br><br>
                  I've been working at Google since 2008. I've worked on a bunch of different things at Google from Maps to Cloud, 
                  and now I work in Ads focused on Ad Policy, and fighting fraud and abuse of the Ad Network to keep our users safe. 
                  <br><br>
                  In the winter time my favorite thing to do is ski. I grew up skiing in Tahoe, hopefully I'll retire there some day and be an old ski bum. 
                  In the summer, I like to spend time in Napa. Let me know if you want my short list of Napa wineries just ping me on slack.
